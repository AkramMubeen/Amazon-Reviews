# Amazon-Reviews

## Overview:

Amazon-Reviews is a project focused on sentiment analysis of Amazon product reviews. The goal is to classify reviews as either positive or negative using machine learning models. This repository contains the necessary files and scripts to understand, develop, and deploy the sentiment analysis application.

## Libraries and Tools Used:

- **Python:** The primary programming language used for the project.

- **Jupyter Notebook:** Utilized for in-depth exploration and analysis in the `AmazonReviews.ipynb` notebook.

- **Pandas:** Used for data manipulation and analysis.

- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):** Employed for text processing tasks such as tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal.

- **Scikit-Learn:** Utilized for various machine learning tasks, including model training, evaluation, and preprocessing.

- **WordCloud:** Utilized for creating word clouds to visually represent the most frequent words in reviews.

- **XGBoost:** A machine learning library used for training a boosted decision tree model.

- **Matplotlib:** Employed for data visualization, including plotting the elbow curve for K-means clustering.

- **Seaborn:** Used for enhanced data visualization.

- **TQDM:** Utilized for creating progress bars during data processing tasks.

- **Docker:** Configuration file (`Dockerfile`) provided for containerization of the application.

- **Flask:** The web application is built using Flask.

## Files:

- **templates:** Directory containing HTML templates for the web application.

- **.gitignore:** Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.

- **AmazonReviews.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook providing an in-depth exploration and analysis of the Amazon reviews dataset.

- **Dockerfile:** Configuration file for Docker, facilitating containerization of the application.

- **LICENSE:** Project license details.

- **LRmodel.pkl:** Pickle file containing a trained Logistic Regression model for sentiment analysis.

- **NBmodel.pkl:** Pickle file containing a trained Naive Bayes model for sentiment analysis.

- **Pipfile:** Specifies project dependencies for Pipenv.

- **Pipfile.lock:** Lock file generated by Pipenv, ensuring reproducibility of the environment.

- **README.md:** The main documentation for the project.

- **app.py:** Python script for running the web application.

- **preprocess.py:** Python script for preprocessing text data before model inference.

- **requirements.txt:** Python package dependencies for traditional virtual environments.

- **vectorizer.pkl:** Pickle file containing a trained vectorizer for text data.
